		<h2>My education now:</h2>
		<h3>
			<p>
				after i returned to normal. I had to choose one of the available
				colleges for the degree that I obtained. I chose the College of
				Commerce. I did not know anything about it until I joined it in the
				first two years of college. I started studying programming as a side
				skill. I did not know that I would love programming so much that I would
				miss college in order to... I stay at home and study programming in the
				first year. I finished HTML and CSS, and I did many projects to develop
				my skills, and all of this was on my own. I did not get any help, only
				YouTube, then I developed, and the next step was JAVASCRIPT. It took me
				a really long time, and I watched... Many videos over and over again,
				and my friend recommended that I take a full paid course on the internet
				because I was distracted. I agreed and waited until the beginning of the
				third year in college and started the course with him. Dr.Angela yu she
				is one of the best programmers I have seen since I started learning
				code. I started the course very seriously and I look forward to getting
				out of this course with another level of programming. This is just the
				beginning and this is just my first project.
